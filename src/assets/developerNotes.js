    "video-game-bracket": "This app uses the RAWG API to fetch video game names and images. The user decides the parameters for the tournament bracket and selects the winners from each round until there is one ultimate winner. I am most proud of my use of recursion to cleanly fetch from the API, aswell as my derived state logic for determining the beginning and end of rounds. The biggest hurdle I experienced with this app was getting it deployed properly, which got me exposed to Copilot for the first time.",
