    "video-game-bracket": "The main challenge for this app was getting it to deploy safely and correctly. I am most proud of my recursive fetching aswell as my use of derived state for the logic used to start and end rounds.",
    "recipe-finder": "Reworking this code to bring context values up to the Layout component was the biggest challenge I faced when building this app. However in the end I believe that is what made the app work smoothly and consistently.",
    "the-wisenbergs": "The placeholder images and lack of real testimonials admittedly make the site feel a little flat at the moment. When given the real personal touches, this website will be a great resource for our trivia team.",
    "quizzical": "Changing the state of the buttons to display them as blue, green, or red was a real struggle that took longer than expected to fix. Overall I believe the end result is clean, responsive, and enjoyable.",
    "gold-digger": "My first app built using Node.js. Not very exciting but did expose me to Node and backend development."
